# Overview

This repository proposes a template for Python projects.

Features :

- Strict dependency management with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- Beautiful documentation with [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- Github actions
- Testing and coverage using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)
- Consistent formatting with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- Lightning-fast linting with [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/)
- Static type checking with [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

I basically used the best practice from EDS-PDF[@edspdf], although I updated a few parts.
