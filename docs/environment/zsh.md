# Using a Decent Shell

Most distributions come with the Bourne Again Shell (bash). You can do better by using Zsh, an alternative to Bash that provides a myriad of bonuses.

## Primer on the Command Line

If this your first time using the command line, you should probably
read this [primer](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners)
by Ubuntu.

Although the tutorial is designed for Ubuntu users, you can follow along with
any Linux or Mac computer. On PC, you'll need the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
I have never done this since I do not own a PC, but I know this is a popular set up
among developers using PC.

## Zsh

### Installation

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH).

### Install oh-my-zsh

oh-my-zsh is a package manager for Zsh. It can help you customize your shell with incredibly useful perks. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#basic-installation).

### Install spaceship-prompt

There are other prompts out there, but Spaceship is a good way to start. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt#oh-my-zsh).

### Configuring your shell

The following `.zshrc` should be a good place to start.

```shell title="~/.zshrc"

# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
# export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"

# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="spaceship"

SPACESHIP_USER_SHOW="always"

SPACESHIP_CHAR_SYMBOL=" âžœ "

# Set list of themes to pick from when loading at random
# Setting this variable when ZSH_THEME=random will cause zsh to load
# a theme from this variable instead of looking in $ZSH/themes/
# If set to an empty array, this variable will have no effect.
# ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=( "robbyrussell" "agnoster" )

# Uncomment the following line to use case-sensitive completion.
# CASE_SENSITIVE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to use hyphen-insensitive completion.
# Case-sensitive completion must be off. _ and - will be interchangeable.
# HYPHEN_INSENSITIVE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to disable bi-weekly auto-update checks.
# DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to automatically update without prompting.
# DISABLE_UPDATE_PROMPT="true"

# Uncomment the following line to change how often to auto-update (in days).
# export UPDATE_ZSH_DAYS=13

# Uncomment the following line if pasting URLs and other text is messed up.
# DISABLE_MAGIC_FUNCTIONS="true"

# Uncomment the following line to disable colors in ls.
# DISABLE_LS_COLORS="true"

# Uncomment the following line to disable auto-setting terminal title.
# DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to enable command auto-correction.
# ENABLE_CORRECTION="true"

# Uncomment the following line to display red dots whilst waiting for completion.
# Caution: this setting can cause issues with multiline prompts (zsh 5.7.1 and newer seem to work)
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/5765
# COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"

# Uncomment the following line if you want to disable marking untracked files
# under VCS as dirty. This makes repository status check for large repositories
# much, much faster.
# DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY="true"

# Uncomment the following line if you want to change the command execution time
# stamp shown in the history command output.
# You can set one of the optional three formats:
# "mm/dd/yyyy"|"dd.mm.yyyy"|"yyyy-mm-dd"
# or set a custom format using the strftime function format specifications,
# see 'man strftime' for details.
# HIST_STAMPS="mm/dd/yyyy"

# Would you like to use another custom folder than $ZSH/custom?
# ZSH_CUSTOM=/path/to/new-custom-folder

# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
plugins=(
git
zsh-syntax-highlighting
)

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# User configuration

export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# export MANPATH="/usr/local/man:$MANPATH"

# You may need to manually set your language environment
# export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

# Preferred editor for local and remote sessions
# if [[ -n $SSH_CONNECTION ]]; then
#   export EDITOR='vim'
# else
#   export EDITOR='mvim'
# fi

# Compilation flags
# export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"

# Set personal aliases, overriding those provided by oh-my-zsh libs,
# plugins, and themes. Aliases can be placed here, though oh-my-zsh
# users are encouraged to define aliases within the ZSH_CUSTOM folder.
# For a full list of active aliases, run `alias`.

# Example aliases
alias zshconfig="micro ~/.zshrc"
alias ohmyzsh="micro ~/.oh-my-zsh"
```

Next, you should install Powerlevel10k. But spaceship is a good place to start.
